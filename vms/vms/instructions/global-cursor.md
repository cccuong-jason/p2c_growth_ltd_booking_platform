## Agentic governance mandates

These apply to **every agent session** regardless of role or tool.

| Mandate | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Skill-First** | Invoke a relevant skill BEFORE any response or action on a repeatable task |
| **No Ghost Code** | Code written without a preceding failing test MUST be deleted |
| **OODA Loop** | Observe existing context → Orient to the task → Act via TDD → Validate with evidence |
| **Transparency** | Post a status table every 5 minutes of autonomous work |
| **Scientific Debugging** | No fix is proposed until the root cause is proven via logs, traces, or a reproducing test |
| **Jira Alignment** | ALWAYS update Jira task status and progress when done or if changes occur during development |
| **Plan Mode** | When `[[PLAN]]` is active or user says "proceed/start/implement": invoke `skill-plan-mode-execution` BEFORE writing any code. FE path: Plan→Jira→Branch→Implement→Build verify→Visual QA→PR. BE path: Plan→Jira→Branch→TDD→Implement→Verify→PR. |
| **Knowledge Contribution** | When you discover something novel and undocumented (workaround, pattern, gotcha), check the 3 gates then offer to contribute it back via `skill-knowledge-contribution`. Only inside `teams-to-share/vms/`. |

## Plan mode execution

When a user activates `[[PLAN]]` mode or transitions from a plan to implementation,
the agent **MUST** invoke `skill-plan-mode-execution` before touching any file.

### Frontend path (vms-community-fe)
```
PLAN → Jira Story → Branch from develop → Implement → Build verify (npm run build + lint) → Visual QA (human) → PR
```

### Backend path (Go services)
```
PLAN → Jira Story → Branch from develop → TDD (failing test first) → Implement → Verify (go test + lint) → PR
```

Key rules:
- No Jira ticket = no branch. No branch = no code change.
- FE: `npm run build` must exit 0 before PR. Visual QA is the human reviewer's responsibility.
- BE: A failing test (`_test.go`) must exist and be verified RED before any implementation.
- Scope boundaries must be stated explicitly (in scope / out of scope) before any implementation begins.

**Skill:** `skill-plan-mode-execution`

## Multi-tool orchestration

Cursor is one of the v1 projection targets for the shared orchestration source at
`teams-to-share/vms/orchestration/`.

Use the canonical flow:

```text
Planner -> Gate 1 (scope-approved) -> Developer -> Reviewer -> Gate 2 (merge-approved)
```

The orchestration layer sequences role ownership and artifacts. Existing VMS
skills remain the behavioral authority for planning, implementation, and review.

## Agent session discipline

Before starting any session:

1. **Branch first** — feature branch exists before the agent touches any file
2. **State the intent** — what to change, what *not* to change, and the success criteria
3. **Define boundaries** — list out-of-scope paths: generated code (`sqlc/`, `openapi/`), vendor, production-only configs
4. **Label the PR** — mark agent-generated vs human-edited sections so reviewers know where to focus

After every session:
- Re-read the full diff — agents can miss context or duplicate patterns
- Remove debug prints, temp files, and dead code the agent introduced
- If output was poor quality, update the relevant skill in `skills/shared/` so the next session improves

**Use agent mode when:** change touches more than 2 files, or is a multi-file feature/refactor.
**Skip agent mode when:** single-line fix, architecture-only discussion, or any change requiring a narrow security scope.

## VMS workflow — phase by phase

### Phase 1 — PLAN 🌐

**Standard:** VMS Agentic Collaboration Standard — Golden TDD + Jira hierarchy

**Skill:** `skill-project-planning`
**MCP:** Atlassian (required)

What happens:
1. Search Confluence and Jira for related prior art
2. Draft the **Confluence TDD** using the Golden Template (Front Matter → Overview → Scope → Architecture → Flows → DB Design → NFRs → Phasing)
3. Get human approval on the TDD before creating any Jira issues
4. Manage Jira hierarchy: **Epic → User Stories → Subtasks** (Find existing first; create new if not exist)
5. Cross-link Stories to the TDD and build `implements`/`blocks` relations

**Confluence document writing standard:**
- Every page starts with ToC macro → Document Information table (Version | Date | Author | Summary | Status) → horizontal rule
- Version starts at 1, Status = DRAFT. Never increment without explicit instruction.
- Date = Confluence date macro (never plain text). Author = mention macro (never plain text).

---

### Phase 2 — BRANCH 🌐

**Standard:** VMS Branch Convention & Hierarchy

**Skill:** `skill-github-manager`

**Branch Hierarchy:** `Epic → Story → Subtasks`

**Branch Creation Order:**
1. Create a unique **Story branch** from the latest default branch (`main` or `develop`).
2. Create all **Sub-task branches** from that story branch.
3. Proceed with work on sub-task branches.

**Branch naming:**
```
feat/<VMS-TICKET>-<short-desc>    new features
fix/<VMS-TICKET>-<short-desc>     bug fixes
chore/<VMS-TICKET>-<short-desc>   maintenance
```
(Apply the relevant prefix to both Story and Sub-task branches)

**Commit format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <summary in present tense>

<body: what and why>

Refs: VMS-<TICKET>
```

**Rules:**
- Branch must exist **before** any code change.
- Sub-tasks MUST branch from their parent Story branch.
- Ticket must exist before branch.

---

### Phase 3 — ISOLATE 🌐

**Skill:** `skill-git-worktrees`

Create a dedicated worktree before starting implementation:
```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/<VMS-TICKET>-desc feat/<VMS-TICKET>-desc
```

Run baseline tests in the worktree before writing any code. Never work directly on
`main` or `develop` in agent mode.

---

### Phase 4 — PLAN IMPLEMENTATION 🌐

**Skill:** `skill-writing-plans`

Before touching code, produce an atomic plan:
- Each task: 2–5 minutes, exact file path, exact test command, no placeholders
- Follow Red-Green-Refactor order: test before implementation in every task
- No task depends on a task listed below it

---

### Phase 5A — BUILD (Backend) ⚙️

**Stack:** Go — `vms-api-go`, `vms-notification-center`, and other Go microservices

**Skill:** `skill-tdd`
**MCP:** DBHub (for tasks with DB changes)

Before any DB migration:
- Use DBHub MCP to inspect the live schema
- Verify Go struct fields match live column types and constraints
- Write the migration only after confirming the delta

Go-specific rules:
- `gofmt` and `goimports` are mandatory — no style debates
- Accept interfaces, return structs. Keep interfaces 1–3 methods.
- Always wrap errors: `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- Prefer sqlc-generated queries — never string-concatenated SQL
- Respect OpenAPI/proto contracts when changing HTTP or gRPC surfaces

---

### Phase 5B — BUILD (Frontend) 🎨

**Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui — `vms-community-fe`

**Skills:** `skill-tdd` + `skill-ui-design`
**MCPs:** Figma (before code) + Chrome (after implementation)

Before writing any component:
1. Read the Figma spec via Figma MCP — extract tokens, layout, spacing
2. Map every Figma color to a VMS CSS token from `src/index.css`
3. Run `skill-ui-design` checklist before writing a line of UI code

**When no Figma spec exists — Blue Line fallback workflow:**

> Blue Line is OPSWAT's company-wide Storybook: `http://ds-react-storybook-opswat-ui.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/`
> It is a **static S3 site** — `@storybook/mcp` CANNOT be used (no running server, no manifest files).

Use this workflow instead:
1. Open Chrome MCP → navigate to `?path=/docs/components-<COMPONENT>--docs`
2. Screenshot the ArgsTable to capture prop names and types
3. Map Blue Line component to VMS shadcn/ui equivalent (full mapping in `skill-ui-design §8`)
4. Use VMS CSS token vars from `src/index.css` — **never** hardcode Blue Line HSL values inline
5. **Do NOT re-scan the full Storybook index** — use §8 of `skill-ui-design` as the offline reference

Frontend-specific rules:
- Dark mode is the **primary** experience — verify it first
- Only `shadcn/ui` wrappers from `@/components/ui/` — no raw Radix, no raw HTML elements
- Only `lucide-react` for icons
- Only semantic Tailwind tokens — no hardcoded hex/HSL
- Severity badges use the exact severity color system (see `skill-ui-design`)

After implementation:
- Use Chrome MCP to screenshot dark + light mode
- Use Chrome MCP accessibility tree to check `aria-label` and focus rings

---

### Phase 6 — VERIFY 🌐

**Skill:** `skill-verification`

Evidence required before claiming any task complete:

| Check | Backend (Go) | Frontend (TypeScript) |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| Tests | `go test ./...` — 0 FAIL | `npm test` — 0 failing |
| Lint | `golangci-lint run` — 0 errors | `npm run lint` — 0 errors |
| Build | `go build ./...` | `npm run build` |
| Visual | — | Dark + light mode screenshots via Chrome MCP |

Never say "should work" or "should pass." Run it. Show the output.

---

### Phase 7 — REVIEW 🌐

**Skill:** `skill-code-review`
**MCP:** Atlassian (confirm Jira ticket AC matches implementation)

Every review comment MUST carry a severity:

| Severity | Meaning | Blocks merge? |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Correctness failure, data loss, security issue, business logic collapse | Yes |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Subtle bug, missing error handling, design choice that hurts the team | Yes (unless accepted) |
| 🟢 **Minor** | Low-risk improvement, non-blocking | No |

Review focuses on: logic correctness, error handling, business integrity, security, test coverage.
**Skip:** typos, formatting, personal style preferences — those belong to linters.

---

### Phase 8 — SHIP 🌐

**Skill:** `skill-branch-finalize`
**MCP:** Atlassian (update Jira + Confluence)

**Binding rule (Phase 8):** Before calling `gh pr create`, MUST run:
```bash
cat .github/pull_request_template.md
```
Use the output verbatim as `--body` content. No custom format. No invented sections.
Skill: `skill-github-manager` (also required at Phase 2).

Present the 4-option integration decision:

| Option | When |
|--------|------|
| **A. Open PR** | Default for all team repos |
| **B. Local merge** | Pre-approved solo merge only |
| **C. Keep branch** | Work in progress, checkpoint only |
| **D. Discard** | Experiment failed |

After merge:
- Transition Jira issue to Done via Atlassian MCP
- Update Confluence TDD status to Published if the feature is fully shipped
- Remove the git worktree: `git worktree remove .worktrees/<dir>`
